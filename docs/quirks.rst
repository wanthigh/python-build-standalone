Backspace Key Doesn't work in Python REPL
=========================================

If you attempt to run ``python`` and the backspace key doesn't
erase characters or the arrow keys don't work as expected, this
is because the executable can't find the *terminfo database*.

A telltale sign of this is the Python REPL printing the following
on startup::

   Cannot read termcap database;
   using dumb terminal settings.

When you type a special key like the backspace key, this is
registered as a key press. There is special software (typically
``readline`` or ``libedit``) that most interactive programs use
that intercepts these special key presses and converts them into
special behavior, such as moving the cursor back instead of
forward. But because computer environments are different,
there needs to be some definition of how these special
behaviors are performed. This is the *terminfo database*.

When ``readline`` and ``libedit`` are compiled, there is
typically a hard-coded set of search locations for the
*terminfo database* baked into the built library. And when
you build a program (like Python) locally, you link against
``readline`` or ``libedit`` and get these default locations
*for free*.

Because python-build-standalone Python distributions compile
and use their own version of ``libedit`` and because the build
environment is different from your machine, the default search
locations for the *terminfo database* built into binaries
distributed with this project may point to a path that doesn't
exist. The *terminfo database* cannot be located and ``libedit``
does not know how to convert special key presses to special behavior.

The solution to this is to set an environment variable
with the location of the *terminfo database*.

If running a Debian based Linux distribution (including Ubuntu)::

   $ TERMINFO_DIRS=/etc/terminfo:/lib/terminfo:/usr/share/terminfo

If running a RedHat based Linux distribution::

   $ TERMINFO_DIRS=/etc/terminfo:/usr/share/terminfo

If running macOS::

   $ TERMINFO_DIRS=/usr/share/terminfo

e.g.::

   $ TERMINFO_DIRS=/etc/terminfo:/lib/terminfo:/usr/share/terminfo install/bin/python3.9

The macOS distributions built with this project should automatically
use the terminfo database in ``/usr/share/terminfo``. Please file
a bug report if the macOS distributions do not behave as expected.

Starting in the first release after 20240107, the Linux distributions are
configured to automatically use the terminfo database in ``/etc/terminfo``,
``/lib/terminfo``, and ``/usr/share/terminfo``.

Also starting in the first release after 20240107, the terminfo database
is distributed in the ``share/terminfo`` directory (``../../share/terminfo``
relative to the ``bin/python3`` executable) in Linux distributions. Note
that ncurses and derived libraries don't know how to find this directory
since they are configured to use absolute paths to the terminfo database
and the absolute path of the Python distribution is obviously not known
at build time! So actually using this bundled terminfo database will
require custom code setting ``TERMINFO_DIRS`` before
ncurses/libedit/readline are loaded.

.. _quirk_macos_no_tix:

No tix on macOS
===============

macOS distributions do not contain tix tcl support files. This means that
``tkinter.tix`` module functionality will likely break at run-time. The
module will import fine. But attempting to instantiate a ``tkinter.tix.Tk``
instance or otherwise attempt to run tix tcl files will result in a run-time
error.

``tkinter.tix`` has been deprecated since Python 3.6 and the official Python
macOS installers do not ship the tix support files. So this project behaves
similarly to the official CPython distributions.

.. _quirk_windows_no_pip:

No ``pip.exe`` on Windows
=========================

The Windows distributions have ``pip`` installed however no ``Scripts/pip.exe``,
``Scripts/pip3.exe``, and ``Scripts/pipX.Y.exe`` files are provided because
the way these executables are built isn't portable. (It might be possible to
change how these are built to make them portable.)

To use pip, run ``python.exe -m pip``. (It is generally a best practice to
invoke pip via ``python -m pip`` on all platforms so you can be explicit
about the ``python`` executable that pip uses.)

.. _quirk_windows_static_distributions:

Windows Static Distributions are Extremely Brittle
==================================================

This project produces statically linked CPython distributions for Windows.

Building these distributions requires extensive patching of CPython's build
system. There are many aspects of CPython, the standard library, and 3rd party
libraries that make assumptions that things will be built as dynamic libraries
and break in these static builds.

Here is a list of known problems:

* Most Windows extension modules link against ``pythonXY.dll`` (e.g.
  ``python39.dll``) or ``python3.dll`` and will fail to load on the static
  distributions. Extension modules will need to be explicitly recompiled
  against the static distribution.
* There is no supported *platform tag* for Windows static distributions and
  therefore there is no supported way to distribute binary wheels targeting
  the Python static distributions.
* Aspects of OpenSSL (and therefore Python's ``ssl`` module) don't work when
  OpenSSL is compiled/linked statically. You will get opaque run-time errors.

It is **highly** recommended to extensively test your application against the
static Windows distributions to ensure it works.

.. _quirk_macos_linking:

Linking Static Library on macOS
===============================

Python 3.9+ makes use of the ``__builtin_available()`` compiler feature.
This functionality requires a symbol from ``libclang_rt``, which may not
be linked by default. Failure to link against ``libclang_rt`` could result
in a linker error due to an undefined symbol ``___isOSVersionAtLeast``.

To work around this linker failure, link against the static library
``libclang_rt.<platform>.a`` present in the Clang installation. e.g.
``libclang_rt.osx.a``. You can find this library by invoking
``clang --print-search-dirs`` and looking in the ``lib/darwin`` directory
under the printed ``libraries`` directory. An example path is
``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/12.0.0/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.osx.a``.

A copy of the ``libclang_rt.<platform>.a`` from the Clang used to build
the distribution is included in the archive. However, it isn't annotated
in ``PYTHON.json`` because we're unsure if using the file with another
build/version of Clang is supported. Use at your own risk.

See https://jonnyzzz.com/blog/2018/06/05/link-error-2/ and
https://jonnyzzz.com/blog/2018/06/13/link-error-3/ for more on this topic.

.. _quirk_linux_libedit:

Use of ``libedit`` on Linux
===========================

Python 3.10+ Linux distributions link against ``libedit`` (as opposed to
``readline``) by default, as ``libedit`` is supported on 3.10+ outside of
macOS.

Most Python builds on Linux will link against ``readline`` because ``readline``
is the dominant library on Linux.

Some functionality may behave subtly differently as a result of our choice
to link ``libedit`` by default. (We choose ``libedit`` by default to
avoid GPL licensing requirements of ``readline``.)

Static Linking of musl libc Prevents Extension Module Library Loading
=====================================================================

Our musl libc linked Linux builds link musl libc statically and the resulting
binaries are completely static and don't have any external dependencies.

Due to how Linux/ELF works, a static/non-dynamic binary cannot call
``dlopen()`` and therefore it cannot load shared library based Python
extension modules (``.so`` based extension modules). This significantly
limits the utility of these Python distributions. (If you want to use
additional extension modules you can use the build artifacts in the
distributions to construct a new ``libpython`` with the additional
extension modules configured as builtin extension modules.)

Another consequence of statically linking musl libc is that our musl
distributions aren't compatible with
`PEP 656 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0656/>`_. PEP 656
stipulates that Python and extension modules are linked against a
dynamic musl. This is what you'll find in Alpine Linux, for example.

See https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/issues/86 for
a tracking issue to improve the state of musl distributions.

.. _quirk_linux_libx11:

Static Linking of ``libX11`` / Incompatibility with PyQt on Linux
=================================================================

The ``_tkinter`` Python extension module in the Python standard library
statically links against ``libX11``, ``libxcb``, and ``libXau`` on Linux.
In addition, the ``_tkinter`` extension module is statically linked into
``libpython`` and isn't a standalone shared library file. This effectively
means that all these X11 libraries are statically linked into the main
Python interpreter.

On typical builds of Python on Linux, ``_tkinter`` will link against
external shared libraries. e.g.::

   $ ldd /usr/lib/python3.9/lib-dynload/_tkinter.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

        libmd.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmd.so.0 (0x00007fdb69cb0000)

The static linking of ``libX11`` and other libraries can cause problems when
3rd party Python extension modules also loading similar libraries are also
loaded into the process. For example, extension modules associated with ``PyQt``
are known to link against a shared ``libX11.so.6``. If multiple versions of
``libX11`` are loaded into the same process, run-time crashes / segfaults can
occur. See e.g. https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/issues/95.

The conceptual workaround is to not statically link ``libX11`` and similar
libraries into ``libpython``. However, this requires re-linking a custom
``libpython`` without ``_tkinter``. It is possible to do this with the object
files included in the distributions. But there isn't a turnkey way to do this.
And you can't easily remove ``_tkinter`` and its symbols from the pre-built
and ready-to-use Python install included in this project's distribution
artifacts.

.. _quirk_missing_libcrypt:

Missing ``libcrypt.so.1``
=========================

Linux distributions in the 20230507 release and earlier had a hard dependency
on ``libcrypt.so.1`` due to static linking of the ``_crypt`` extension module,
which imports it.

Presence of ``libcrypt.so.1`` is mandated as part of the Linux Standard Base
Core Specification and therefore should be present in Linux environments
conforming to this specification. Most Linux distributions historically
attempted to conform to this specification.

In 2022, various Linux distributions stopped shipping ``libcrypt.so.1``
(it appears glibc is ceasing to provide this functionality and Linux
distributions aren't backfilling ``libcrypt.so.1`` in the base install
to remain compatible with the Linux Standard Base Core Specification).

In reaction to Linux distributions no longer providing ``libcrypt.so.1`` by
default, we changed the configuration of the ``_crypt`` extension module so
it is compiled/distributed as a standalone shared library and not compiled
into libpython. This means a missing ``libcrypt.so.1`` is only relevant if
the Python interpreter imports the ``crypt`` / ``_crypt`` modules.

If you are using an older release of this project with a hard dependency
on ``libcrypt.so.1`` and don't want to upgrade, you can instruct end-users
to install a ``libxcrypt-compat`` (or comparable) package to provide the
missing ``libcrypt.so.1``.

See https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/issues/113 and
https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/issues/173 for additional
context on this matter.

.. _quirk_references_to_build_paths:

References to Build-Time Paths
==============================

The built Python distribution captures some absolute paths and other
build-time configuration in a handful of files:

* In a ``_sysconfigdata_*.py`` file in the standard library. e.g.
  ``lib/python3.10/_sysconfigdata__linux_x86_64-linux-gnu.py``.
* In a ``Makefile`` under a ``config-*`` directory in the standard library.
  e.g. ``lib/python3.10/config-3.10-x86_64-linux-gnu/Makefile``.
* In ``pkgconfig`` files. e.g. ``lib/pkgconfig/python3.pc``.
* In ``python*-config`` files. e.g. ``bin/python3.10-config``.
* In ``PYTHON.json`` (mostly reflected values from ``_sysconfigdata_*.py``.

Each of these serves a different use case. But the general theme is various
aspects of the Python distribution attempt to capture how Python was built.
The most common use of these values is to facilitate compiling or linking
other software against this Python build. For example, the ``_sysconfigdata*``
module is loaded by the `sysconfig <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html>`_
module. ``sysconfig`` in turn is used by packaging tools like ``setuptools``
and ``pip`` to figure out how to invoke a compiler for e.g. compiling C
extensions from source.

On Linux, our distributions are built in containers. The container has a
custom build of Clang in a custom filesystem location. And Python is
installed to the prefix ``/install``. So you may see references to
``/install`` in Linux distributions.

On macOS, most distributions are built from GitHub Actions runners. They
use a specific macOS SDK. So you may see references to SDK paths that don't
exist on your machine. e.g.
``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX12.3.sdk``.

On Windows, builds are performed from a temporary directory. So you may
see references to temporary directories in Windows distributions.

**The existence of hard-coded paths in our produced distributions can confuse
consumers of these values and break common workflows, like compiling C
extensions.**

We don't currently have a great idea for how to solve this problem. We
can't hardcode values that will work on every machine because every machine
has different filesystem layouts. For example, if we hardcode ``gcc`` as
the compiler, someone with only ``clang`` installed will complain. And
we certainly don't know where end-users will extract their Python
distribution to!

To solve this problem requires executing dynamic code after extracting
our custom distributions in order to patch these hardcoded values into
conformance with the new machine. We're unsure how to actually do this
because figuring out what values to set is essentially equivalent to
reinventing autoconf / configure! Perhaps we could implement something
that works in common system layouts (e.g. hardcoded defaults for common
distros like Debian/Ubuntu and RedHat).

Until we have a better solution here, just understand that anything looking
at ``sysconfig`` could resolve non-existent paths or names of binaries that
don't exist on the current machine.

Starting with the Linux and macOS distributions released in 2024, we do
normalize some values in these files at build time. Normalizations include:

* Removing compiler flags that are non-portable.
* Removing references to build paths (e.g. ``/tools`` on Linux).

If there is a build time normalization that you think should be performed to
make distributions more portable, please file a GitHub issue.
